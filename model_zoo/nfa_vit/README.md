# NFA-ViT pretrained Weight

The initial weights of NFA-ViT consist of three parts: DnCNN, imagebackbone, and noisebackbone, with corresponding noiseprint.pth, segformer_b2_backbone_weights.pth and segformer_b0_backbone_weights.pth. We also provide the training weights of NFA-ViT on BR-Gen, and all ownership files are included in  [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1mqmMeoTzJf0TuIy17N6PFQ) (Password: cclp).



For the loading method of the model, please refer to IMDLBenCo's official weight loading method, and we will keep it consistent with it.
